Usage instructions for BeIndexed
----------------------------------------

The applications are in the bin folder.

Indexing - no GUI so far, so you'll have to run it from a Terminal:

Run "Indexer [path to folder to index, for example /boot/home]". This will index the folder
and all it's subfolders. If there's a folder you wish that Indexer should ignore, you can set
a string attribute named "BeIndexed:Rule" to "ignore" on it and it will be ignored.
So far you'll have to do this manually from a Terminal using something like "addattr", not
sure if that's included in all BeOS versions or not.

Finding:

Run Finder, enter some words, double-click the matches.
It would be a good idea to not have the indexer running while you're doing this, since I had
to remove the file locking from SQLite to make it work. Worst case scenario: Finder gets
lost and crashes. The Indexer should have no problems.
